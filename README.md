## Project Overview

### Project Background

Sarcasm is a prevalent rhetorical device encountered in social media, news comments, or everyday conversations. However, it presents a considerable challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate sarcasm detection model to understand textual content more accurately in various applications such as sentiment analysis and public opinion monitoring.

### Key Features

- **Sarcasm Detection**: Utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms to classify the sarcastic sentiment of the input text.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Through interaction with relevant external knowledge bases (like Wikipedia), the model can grasp the text's context more accurately.
- **Multilevel Analysis**: Beyond basic text analysis, the model employs advanced features like multi-head attention mechanisms and bi-directional LSTM to capture complex relationships within the text.

### Technology Stack

- **PyTorch**: Used for model building and training.
- **Flair**: Employed for text classification and natural language processing tasks.
- **Transformer**: Word embeddings based on the Roberta model.
- **AdamW**: Serves as the model's optimizer.
- **OneCycleLR**: Utilized for learning rate scheduling.
